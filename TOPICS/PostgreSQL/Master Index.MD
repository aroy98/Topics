# 🐘 PostgreSQL Mastery Series – Master Index (Parts I–X)

---

## 📘 Overview

This Master Index outlines all ten parts of the **PostgreSQL Mastery Series**, from fundamentals to advanced production operations. Each part builds upon the previous one to help you achieve full-stack proficiency with PostgreSQL — from installation and data modeling to scaling, replication, and observability.

Each section is available for export in **Markdown (.md)**, **PDF (.pdf)**, and **Word (.docx)** formats.

## 🧩 Series Outline

### **Part I – Core Fundamentals**

Set up PostgreSQL on various platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, Docker). Learn about databases, schemas, tables, and essential SQL operations (DDL, DML, DQL). Includes data types, NULL handling, sorting, and a mini HR project.

### **Part II – SQL Mastery**

Covers advanced querying: JOINs, subqueries, CTEs, window functions, grouping, aggregates, and set operations. Introduces views, materialized views, and analytics-style SQL problems.

### **Part III – Data Modeling & Constraints**

Design efficient schemas using normalization, primary/foreign keys, unique/check constraints, generated columns, and partitioning strategies. Includes a complete HR management schema project.

### **Part IV – Administration & Configuration**

Dive into PostgreSQL architecture, roles, privileges, pg_hba.conf, key parameters (`shared_buffers`, `work_mem`), autovacuum, and connection pooling. Includes performance tuning and system monitoring essentials.

### **Part V – Indexing & Performance**

Deep-dive into index types (B-Tree, GIN, GiST, BRIN), query planning, EXPLAIN/ANALYZE, statistics, VACUUM tuning, and performance anti-patterns. Introduces Full-Text Search and a mini performance-tuning project.

### **Part VI – Concurrency & Transactions**

Explains MVCC, isolation levels, locks, deadlocks, advisory locks, HOT updates, and connection pooling with PgBouncer. Includes a safe transaction mini-project for money transfers.

### **Part VII – Backup, Restore & High Availability**

Master logical and physical backups (`pg_dump`, `pg_basebackup`), WAL archiving, point-in-time recovery (PITR), streaming and logical replication, and failover automation using tools like `repmgr` and `Patroni`.

### **Part VIII – Extensions & Advanced Features**

Explore PostgreSQL’s extensibility: JSONB, PostGIS, pg_trgm, citext, hstore, FDWs, and PL/pgSQL for procedural logic and triggers. Includes a mini project combining JSON, FTS, FDWs, and triggers.

### **Part IX – Security, Auditing & Compliance**

Harden PostgreSQL with roles, RLS, SSL/TLS, pgcrypto encryption, pg_audit, and data masking. Align with GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2, and PCI-DSS standards using real-world examples.

### **Part X – Production Ops & Observability**

Operate PostgreSQL in production: monitoring, logging, dashboards (Prometheus + Grafana), upgrades, migrations, and cloud scaling (AWS RDS, GCP Cloud SQL). Includes a production-ready deployment blueprint.
