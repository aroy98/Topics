## **Part 1: Core Fintech + Technical Questions**

### **1. What is Fintech?**

Fintech (Financial Technology) combines **finance and technology** to enhance financial services like digital payments, lending, and wealth management. It leverages modern tools such as APIs, AI, and blockchain to improve speed, accessibility, and compliance.

### **2. What are the core technologies used in fintech software engineering?**

* **Backend:** Node.js, Python, Go, Java
* **Frontend:** React, Angular, Vue.js
* **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL
* **Cloud:** AWS, GCP, Azure
* **Security:** JWT, OAuth2, AES encryption
* **Integration:** Stripe, Razorpay, PayPal APIs
* **Monitoring:** Grafana, Prometheus, ELK Stack

### **3. What is PCI DSS and why is it important?**

PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) ensures secure processing, storage, and transmission of cardholder data.
**Importance:** Prevents data breaches and protects user trust.

### **4. Explain the payment flow in a fintech system.**

1. User initiates payment on app/website.
2. Payment gateway encrypts and forwards data to acquiring bank.
3. Acquiring bank ‚Üí Card network (Visa/MasterCard).
4. Network ‚Üí Issuing bank for authorization.
5. Response flows back ‚Üí Payment confirmation.

### **5. How do you handle transaction atomicity?**

Use **ACID** transactions and rollback mechanisms to ensure complete consistency.

```js
const client = await pool.connect();
try {
  await client.query('BEGIN');
  await client.query('UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id=1');
  await client.query('UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id=2');
  await client.query('COMMIT');
} catch (err) {
  await client.query('ROLLBACK');
}
client.release();
```

### **6. Payment Gateway vs Processor**

| Feature | Payment Gateway                       | Payment Processor                     |
| ------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Role    | Interface between merchant & customer | Connects merchant bank & issuing bank |
| Example | Razorpay, Stripe                      | Visa, MasterCard                      |

### **7. How do you secure APIs in fintech?**

* HTTPS for all communications.
* OAuth2 or JWT tokens for authorization.
* Input validation and rate limiting.
* AES encryption for sensitive data.

### **8. How do you ensure idempotency in APIs?**

Assign an **idempotency key** for each request to prevent duplicate payments.

```js
if (db.has(key)) return db.get(key);
else {
  const result = processPayment();
  db.set(key, result);
  return result;
}
```

### **9. What is KYC and why is it important?**

KYC (Know Your Customer) verifies customer identity before onboarding.
It prevents fraud, terrorism financing, and money laundering.

### **10. Explain UPI architecture.**

UPI (Unified Payments Interface) facilitates instant fund transfers using VPAs.
**Flow:** Customer ‚Üí UPI App ‚Üí NPCI Switch ‚Üí Issuer Bank ‚Üí Receiver Bank ‚Üí Settlement.

### **11. Database design best practices in fintech**

* Use **ACID** for transaction integrity.
* Encrypt sensitive data.
* Maintain **audit trails** and version control.
* Normalize and partition large tables.

### **12. Scalable transaction service design**

API Gateway ‚Üí Payment Microservice ‚Üí Kafka Queue ‚Üí Ledger DB ‚Üí Notification Service.

### **13. Ledger DB vs Transaction DB**

| Feature | Ledger DB                | Transaction DB         |
| ------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Nature  | Immutable                | Mutable CRUD           |
| Purpose | Financial record keeping | Real-time transactions |

### **14. How to handle concurrency in balance updates?**

Use **row-level locking**, optimistic concurrency control, or transaction queues.

### **15. AML and the engineer‚Äôs role**

Anti-Money Laundering involves tracking and flagging suspicious transactions. Engineers build rule engines and data pipelines for AML alerts.

### **16. Explain double-entry accounting.**

Every transaction affects two accounts: one debit and one credit. Ensures total balance consistency.

### **17. Implementing audit trails**

Use append-only logs with timestamps to track all actions and modifications.

### **18. Why prioritize consistency over availability?**

In financial systems, losing data integrity is worse than downtime.

### **19. Fraud prevention techniques**

* Device fingerprinting and IP checks.
* Velocity limits.
* AI anomaly detection.
* Multi-factor authentication.

### **20. Monitoring and observability**

Use ELK stack for logs and Prometheus for metrics.
Set up alerts for transaction failures or latency.

## **Part 2: Advanced System Design, Cloud, and Security**

### **21. Designing a high-availability payment service**

Use multi-region deployment, load balancers, database replication, and asynchronous messaging (Kafka) to ensure 99.99% uptime.

### **22. Scaling fintech systems**

Implement **microservices** with independent scaling, use **stateless APIs**, **CDNs**, and **auto-scaling groups**.

### **23. Ledger system design**

Immutable tables ensure no data tampering. Use **double-entry** rules to ensure auditability.

### **24. ACID vs BASE**

ACID for transactional accuracy; BASE for analytical scalability.

### **25. Data privacy in fintech**

Encrypt sensitive fields using AES-256, restrict internal access, and anonymize logs.

### **26. Tokenization**

Replace card data with random tokens for PCI compliance. Only a secure vault can map tokens back.

### **27. Rate limiting implementation**

Limit user requests to prevent DDoS attacks.

```js
const key = `rate:${userId}`;
const current = await redis.incr(key);
if (current === 1) redis.expire(key, 60);
if (current > 100) return res.status(429).send('Too many requests');
next();
```

### **28. Fraud detection system**

Use real-time streaming and ML-based scoring models to detect abnormal spending patterns.

### **29. Event-driven architecture**

Improves scalability and fault isolation by processing messages asynchronously.

### **30. Cloud compliance**

Follow PCI DSS and ISO 27001; encrypt data in transit (TLS) and at rest (KMS), audit all access.

### **31. Observability**

Track metrics (Prometheus), logs (ELK), and traces (Jaeger). Alerts sent via PagerDuty.

### **32. Disaster recovery**

Maintain RPO ‚â§ 5 mins, RTO ‚â§ 30 mins with replication and automated failover.

### **33. Testing fintech systems**

Unit ‚Üí Integration ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Compliance testing (OWASP, JMeter, Postman).

### **34. Sandbox environments**

Test APIs in isolated environments using fake transactions (e.g., Stripe Sandbox).

### **35. Secret management**

Use AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault. Rotate and never hardcode credentials.
