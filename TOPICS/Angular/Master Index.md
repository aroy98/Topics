# 🅰️ Angular Mastery Series – Master Index (Parts I–X)

---

## 📘 Overview

This index lists all ten parts of the **Angular Mastery Series**, from fundamentals to enterprise architecture, SSR (Angular Universal), RxJS/NgRx, performance, testing, security, and production deployments.

Each part is designed to be exportable in **Markdown (.md)**, **PDF (.pdf)**, and **Word (.docx)** formats.

## 🧩 Series Structure

### **Part I – Core Fundamentals**
TypeScript essentials for Angular, Angular project anatomy, standalone components, templates, data binding, directives (`*ngIf`, `*ngFor`), pipes, and change detection basics.

### **Part II – Components & Templates Deep Dive**
Input/Output bindings, view encapsulation, content projection (`ng-content`), lifecycle hooks, template refs, host binding/listeners, and accessibility.

### **Part III – Dependency Injection & Services**
Angular DI system, providers (root/feature/component), hierarchical injectors, tokens, `inject()` API, standalone bootstrapping, and service design patterns.

### **Part IV – Routing & Navigation**
Standalone Router setup, route configs, lazy loading, guards/resolvers, router events, preloading strategies, and nested routes.

### **Part V – Forms (Template-Driven & Reactive)**
Choosing forms strategy, reactive forms API, form builders, validation, custom validators, async validation, form arrays, control value accessors, and best practices.

### **Part VI – RxJS & State Management (NgRx)**
RxJS operators, marble thinking, component-level streams, smart vs. presentational components, NgRx Store/Effects/Entity/Signals interop, selectors, facade pattern, and testing.

### **Part VII – HTTP, Interceptors & Data Access**
`HttpClient` best practices, interceptors (auth, retry, caching), error handling, typed APIs, pagination/infinite scroll patterns, and backend integration tips.

### **Part VIII – Performance & Optimization**
Change detection strategies (`Default` vs `OnPush`), `signals` and `computed`, `trackBy`, `*ngFor` perf, memoization, virtualization, code-splitting, and bundle analysis.

### **Part IX – Testing, Tooling & CI/CD**
Unit testing with Jest/Jasmine, TestBed best practices, component harnesses, E2E with Cypress/Playwright, Storybook for Angular, linting/formatting, and GitHub Actions/Nx CI.

### **Part X – Advanced Topics & Final Review**
Angular Universal (SSR/SSG), i18n, security (XSS/CSP/DOMSanitizer), PWAs, micro-frontends with Module Federation, Nx monorepos, observability, and architectural review checklist.
